Draw on Canvas in JavaScript
The canvas element was introduced in HTML5, it can be used to draw graphics via JavaScript. This can be used for many purposes including games, visualizations, charts, graphs, etc.

cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/stack-x/html-starter.git draw
cd draw
rm -fR .git
```

Now that you can add basic shapes to the canvas lets work on the colors.
* A value of 0 should load the the trackX and trackY elements on page render.
* Can you figure out how to draw a triangle?
* Add color pickers that will allow the user to select the stroke and fill colors for various objects they are using.
```sh
Hint: HTML5 has a built-in form element that spawns a color picker.
